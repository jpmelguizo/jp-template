# jp-template

Template for Middleman projects using gulp-sass and browser-sync through Middleman's [external pipeline feature](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/external-pipeline/). It includes some other features like syntax highlight, js concatenation and some basic styles. Modified from  [mm-template](https://github.com/NathanBowers/mm-template). I use it mainly for small personal projects.

## Requirements

- Middleman: for a how to install guide, go to the [official docs](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/).
- Node.js + npm: [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) recommended.

Run 'npm install' before running 'middleman' or 'middleman build'.
